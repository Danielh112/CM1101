All the work has paid off, you've finally cracked it.
The secret to immortality. Your successful test subject DELETED lies in front of you.
You are due to present it to the world tomorrow.
Your team have all gone home but you stayed to make sure everything was perfect.
It would be a good idea to wake the subject and perform some fianl checks.
It would be devastating if something went wrong tomorrow.

You turn on the life support systems, the subject starts to move its fingers and its eyes flash open.

Something's wrong...
ERROR ERROR ERROR. Red lights are flashing all over your displays. Its head jerks up with its eyes staring right
at you, it begins grunting unintelligibly. The subject destroys the restrains with a huge roar, leaving a mangled
mess of metal on the floor. It lumbers towards you, arm outstretched. The last thing you see is its hand around
your neck as you fade from conciousness.
